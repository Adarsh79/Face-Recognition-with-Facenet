- Face embedding extraction with FaceNet
- Face classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Live video stream processing for real-time recognition
- Comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorials

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- MTCNN
- FaceNet
- Haar Cascade Classifiers

## üìä Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Part 1: Model Development**
   - Setting up the development environment
   - Implementing MTCNN for face detection
   - Extracting face embeddings using FaceNet
   - Training an SVM classifier for face recognition

2. **Part 2: Real-time Implementation**
   - Integrating the trained models into a real-time system
   - Processing live video streams for face detection and recognition
   - Demonstrating recognition capabilities on multiple individuals

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh79/Face-Recognition-with-Facenet.git
   cd Face-Recognition-with-Facenet
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

### Running the Code

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks in order:
   - `model/Face_Recognition_using_Facenet.ipynb`
   - `main.py`

3. For real-time recognition, run:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## üìà Results and Performance

The system demonstrates high accuracy in real-time face recognition, successfully identifying multiple individuals in live video streams. Performance metrics and detailed analysis can be found in the `results` directory.

## üî¨ Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced face detection algorithms
